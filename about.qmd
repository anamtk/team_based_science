### Dr. Katharyn Duffy

Katharyn is the Director of R&D Science Operations at [Vibrant Planet](https://www.vibrantplanet.net/) and adjunct faculty in the School of Informatics, Computing & Cyber Systems at Northern Arizona University.  Dr. Duffy works at the intersection of forestry, wildfire, and EcoInformatics - ecology and ‘big data’. She co-authored the first wildfire-focused forest carbon methodology, and continues to innovate data-driven methods to support natural climate solutions. Katharyn’s focus at Vibrant Planet includes building data and interfaces to support monitoring, reporting, and forecasting the ecosystem benefits of sustainable forest management. Katharyn’s broader work also includes developing and supporting courses and open-source textbooks on Interdisciplinary Team-Based Science and Ecological Informatics using Open Research Infrastructures and their Data to support open, reproducible, and inclusive science.

### Dr. Ana Miller-ter Kuile

Ana is a Postdoctoral Scholar in SICCS working with Dr. Kiona Ogle. She received her Ph.D. in Ecology from UC Santa Barbara and her B.S. in Earth Systems- Biosphere Track from Stanford University. Her general research interests include modeling and understanding how biological communities are impacted and respond to anthropogenic change, including species introductions and losses, invasive species, habitat change, climate change, and restoration efforts aimed at reversing or directing these changes. Ana has a background in community ecology and combines field, laboratory, and computational approaches in her work. She is also a Software Carpentries instructor and has training and experience with equitable STEM and data science education through an NSF-AGEP Hispanic Serving Institutions Teaching Fellowship and the Environmental Data Science Inclusion Network.
