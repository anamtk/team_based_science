Katharyn Duffy & Ana Miller-ter Kuile\n\n\nIn this course, you will learn team-science skills for engaging in collaborative research, and for being a productive member of high-performing teams. You will work in small teams (3-4 members) to develop an interdisciplinary research product (proposal, manuscript, or code package) with an emphasis on applying informatics tools to address a biological, ecological, or environmental-motivated problem. You will learn and employ team-science approaches to developing this proposal and to conducting preliminary research that aligns with the proposal. You will present as a team on the proposed project, approaches, and initial results.\n\n# Instructors\n\n#### Dr. Katharyn Duffy \n\n##### Email:\n\n##### Office Hours:\n\n#### Dr. Ana Miller-ter Kuile\n\n##### Email: ana.miller-ter-kuile\\@nau.edu\n\n##### Office Hours:\n\n\\\n\n# \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"yeti","title":"INF 690: Team-based Interdisciplinary Research"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
