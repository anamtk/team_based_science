Katharyn Duffy & Ana Miller-ter Kuile\n\nWelcome!\nIn this course, you will learn team-science skills for engaging in collaborative research, and for being a productive member of high-performing teams. You will work in small teams (3-4 members) to develop an interdisciplinary research product (proposal, manuscript, or code package) with an emphasis on applying informatics tools to address a biological, ecological, or environmental-motivated problem. You will learn and employ team-science approaches to developing this proposal and to conducting preliminary research that aligns with the proposal. You will present as a team on the proposed project, approaches, and initial results.\n\n\nInstructors\n\nDr. Katharyn Duffy\n\nEmail:\n\n\nOffice Hours:\n\n\n\nDr. Ana Miller-ter Kuile\n\nEmail: ana.miller-ter-kuile@nau.edu\n\n\nOffice Hours:"
